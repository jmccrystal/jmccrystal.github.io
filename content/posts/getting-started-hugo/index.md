Hugo is one of the fastest static site generators available today, built with Go and designed for speed and simplicity. In this post, I'll walk through why I chose Hugo for my personal site and some key benefits it offers.

## Why Choose Hugo?

### Speed
Hugo can generate thousands of pages in milliseconds. This makes it perfect for both development and build times, especially when working with continuous deployment.

### Simplicity
- Write content in Markdown
- Use Go templating for layouts
- Single binary installation
- No database required

### Flexibility
Hugo supports various content types, custom taxonomies, and powerful theming capabilities. You can create blogs, documentation sites, portfolios, and more.

## Basic Hugo Commands

Here are some essential Hugo commands to get you started:

```bash
# Create a new Hugo site
hugo new site mysite

# Create a new post
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

# Start the development server
hugo server -D

# Build the site for production
hugo
```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

Hugo integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions for automated deployment:

1. Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Configure Hugo to build your site
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically on push

This approach ensures your site is always up-to-date with your latest content changes.

## Conclusion

Hugo strikes an excellent balance between simplicity and power. Whether you're building a personal blog or a complex documentation site, Hugo provides the tools you need without unnecessary complexity.
