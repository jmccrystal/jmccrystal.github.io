## Overview

The CS50 Typing Test is an interactive Python application that measures typing speed and accuracy through an engaging graphical interface. Built as part of Harvard's CS50 course, this project demonstrates desktop application development, client-server architecture, and user interface design principles.

The application features real-time WPM calculation, randomized test words, and both local and online leaderboards to track performance over time.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time WPM Calculation**: Live updates as you type
- **Randomized Word Sets**: Different challenges each session  
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Measures both speed and precision
- **User Validation**: Input validation for user initials
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed statistics after each test

### Leaderboard System
- **Local Leaderboard**: Track personal progress over time
- **Online Leaderboard**: Compare with other users globally
- **Score Persistence**: Saves results across sessions
- **Performance History**: View improvement trends

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **GUI Framework**: PySimpleGUI for cross-platform desktop interface
- **Backend**: Flask web framework for server-side functionality
- **Data Storage**: Pickle for local data persistence
