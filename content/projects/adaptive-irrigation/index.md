## Overview

An IoT system that integrates Netatmo weather station data with Rainbird sprinkler controllers to optimize irrigation based on real-time rainfall and soil conditions.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Integration
- **Netatmo Weather Station**: Real-time rainfall, temperature, humidity monitoring
- **Rainbird Sprinkler System**: Automated zone control and scheduling
- **Raspberry Pi**: Central processing unit and communication hub

### Software Stack
```python
# Weather data polling
class WeatherMonitor:
    def __init__(self, station_id, api_key):
        self.client = NetatmoClient(api_key)
        self.station_id = station_id
    
    async def get_rainfall_data(self, hours=24):
        data = await self.client.get_station_data(self.station_id)
        return data['rain']['sum_24h']
```

### Decision Algorithm
- **Rainfall threshold**: Skip irrigation if >5mm in 24h
- **Soil moisture modeling**: Evapotranspiration calculations
- **Weather forecasting**: API integration for predictive scheduling

## Technical Implementation

### API Integrations
- **Netatmo API**: OAuth2 authentication, REST endpoints for sensor data
- **Rainbird API**: Local network communication with controller units
- **Weather forecasting**: OpenWeatherMap integration for future conditions

### Control Logic
```python
def calculate_irrigation_need(rainfall, temperature, humidity, forecast):
    et0 = calculate_evapotranspiration(temperature, humidity)
    water_deficit = et0 - rainfall
    
    if forecast['rain_probability'] > 60:
        return False  # Skip irrigation
    
    return water_deficit > IRRIGATION_THRESHOLD
```

### Data Persistence
- **SQLite**: Historical weather and irrigation data
- **Logging**: System events and decision audit trail
- **CSV exports**: Data analysis and system optimization

## System Features

### Automation Logic
- **Dynamic scheduling**: Adjusts timing based on weather conditions
- **Zone-specific control**: Different plants have different water requirements
- **Manual override**: Emergency controls and system testing

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Real-time status**: Web dashboard for system monitoring
- **SMS alerts**: Critical system failures and maintenance reminders
- **Data visualization**: Charts for rainfall, irrigation, and system performance

## Performance Results
- **Water savings**: 35% reduction in water usage vs. traditional timers
- **Plant health**: Improved growth rates with optimal moisture levels
- **System reliability**: 99.2% uptime over 6-month deployment period
