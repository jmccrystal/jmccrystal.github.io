## Overview

nostd-alloc is a personal learning project that implements basic memory allocation and collections in a `no_std` Rust environment. This project represents a deep dive into the fundamentals of memory management, exploring how core data structures work at the lowest level.

By building essential components like custom allocators, `Vec`, and `String` from scratch without the standard library, this project demonstrates a thorough understanding of systems programming fundamentals.

## Project Goals

This educational project was designed to explore several key areas:

- **Low-level memory management in Rust**
- **Allocation and collection internals** 
- **Building fundamental data structures from first principles**
- **Working in constrained computational environments**

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### Custom Memory Allocator
- Implements memory allocation using `mmap` system calls
- Manages memory chunks and handles allocation/deallocation
- Provides a foundation for higher-level data structures

#### Data Structures
- **Custom Vec**: Dynamic array implementation without standard library
- **Custom String**: String handling in constrained environments
- **Basic I/O**: Fundamental input/output operations

#### No Standard Library Design
- All functionality built from scratch
- No reliance on `std` library components  
- Designed for embedded or bare-metal environments

## Key Learning Outcomes

### Memory Management Fundamentals
- Understanding how memory allocators work internally
- Learning about memory layout and alignment requirements
- Exploring the relationship between the heap and system calls

### Rust Systems Programming
- Working with raw pointers and unsafe code
- Understanding Rust's ownership model at the lowest level
- Building safe abstractions over unsafe primitives

### Embedded/Bare-Metal Programming
- Programming without standard library support
- Working within severe resource constraints
- Understanding the minimal requirements for basic functionality

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Memory Safety
- Ensuring memory safety without garbage collection
- Preventing memory leaks and use-after-free bugs
- Building safe interfaces over unsafe memory operations

### Resource Management
- Efficient memory usage in constrained environments
- Minimizing allocation overhead
- Handling allocation failures gracefully

### API Design
- Creating intuitive interfaces for low-level functionality
- Balancing safety with performance requirements
- Maintaining compatibility with Rust's type system

## Educational Value

This project serves as an excellent example of learning through implementation:

> "A personal learning project implementing basic memory allocation and collections in a `no_std` Rust environment."

By reimplementing fundamental components that we typically take for granted, the project provides deep insights into:
- How programming languages manage memory
- The relationship between high-level abstractions and system calls
- The complexity hidden behind simple operations like `Vec::push()`

## Future Explorations

Potential extensions to this learning project include:
- [ ] Implementing more sophisticated allocation strategies
- [ ] Adding garbage collection experiments
- [ ] Exploring different memory models (stack, heap, etc.)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against standard implementations
- [ ] Integration with actual embedded hardware
