## Hi, I'm James McCrystal üëã

I'm a self-taught systems programming specialist based in Los Angeles, CA. My passion lies in building innovative solutions at the intersection of low-level systems programming and modern web technologies. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I document my technical journey, share insights, and explore the depths of computer science.

### What I Do

I specialize in **systems programming** with a focus on **Rust**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**. My work spans from bare-metal memory allocation libraries to modern web applications, always with an emphasis on performance, security, and elegant code architecture.

**Current Focus Areas:**
- **Systems Programming**: Building custom allocators and low-level libraries in Rust
- **Web Development**: Full-stack applications using Next.js and TypeScript  
- **Network Programming**: Client-server architectures and communication protocols
- **Educational Tools**: Creating interactive applications that make learning more engaging

### My Technical Journey

My path into programming has been driven by curiosity and hands-on learning. I've built everything from custom memory allocators in `no_std` Rust environments to digital platforms connecting people across cultural divides. Each project teaches me something new about both technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.

**Notable Projects:**
- **vertex-rs**: A multithreaded network communication system in Rust
- **nostd-alloc**: Custom memory allocation library for embedded/bare-metal environments
- **OtherSide**: A digital pen pal platform fostering understanding across different viewpoints
- **CS50 Typing Test**: Interactive Python application with online leaderboards

### My Philosophy

I believe technology should bridge gaps, not create them. Whether I'm writing low-level system code or building user-facing applications, I focus on creating tools that are both technically sound and genuinely useful. My interest in projects like OtherSide reflects my belief that technology can help us understand each other better.

### Technical Interests

- **Rust Programming**: Memory safety, concurrency, and systems-level development
- **Network Programming**: Protocol design, client-server architectures
- **Web Technologies**: Modern frameworks, TypeScript, full-stack development
- **Computer Science Fundamentals**: Algorithms, data structures, memory management
- **Security Research**: Understanding system vulnerabilities and defensive programming

### Connect With Me

I'm always interested in discussing technology, collaborating on interesting projects, or helping fellow developers. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about systems programming, share ideas about a project, or just connect!
